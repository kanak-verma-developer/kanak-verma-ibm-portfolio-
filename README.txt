# 💻 Professional Portfolio: Frontend Development & Data Science

**Developed By:** Kanak Verma
**Role:** Frontend Intern (Remote)
**Organization:** IBM
**Internship Period:** August 2025 – October 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, single-page professional portfolio application designed and built as a key deliverable during my Frontend Internship at IBM.

It serves as a dynamic resume, showcasing my core competencies in **Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JS)**, my academic specialization in **Data Science**, and my application of industry best practices like modular code structure and accessible design.

## ✨ Technical Features Implemented

The project is built around **clean, vanilla JavaScript** for logic and modern CSS for presentation, avoiding heavy frameworks to demonstrate foundational skill mastery.

### 1. **Modular Code Architecture**
* **Separation of Concerns:** Strict adherence to **SoC** by dividing code into three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) for enhanced maintainability and scalability.
* **Semantic HTML5:** Used descriptive tags to improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

### 2. **Dynamic UI/UX Components**
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** Implemented a persistent, user-controlled theme switcher using JavaScript and CSS variables (`body.dark`) to enhance accessibility and user preference.
* **Interactive Project Modals:** Used DOM manipulation to display project details in a non-disruptive overlay, improving user experience.
* **Hamburger Menu (Mobile):** Responsive navigation handling for seamless experience on smaller screens.

### 3. **Performance & Visualization**
* **Scroll-Triggered Skill Animation:** Custom JavaScript logic detects when the "Skills" section enters the viewport and animates the progress bars (`<div>`) using CSS transitions, providing an engaging visual representation of proficiency.
* **Responsive Image Handling:** Ensured images scale correctly across various screen sizes using media queries and responsive units.

## 💡 Internship Learning Highlights

During this project and the internship, I gained hands-on experience in:

* **Agile Documentation:** The importance of detailed READMEs and clear commit messages in a professional setting.
* **Code Review Principles:** Writing clean, readable code that is easy for teammates to review and integrate.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Testing and ensuring a consistent look and feel across different browser environments.
* **Integration Mindset:** Structuring the frontend (e.g., Contact Form inputs) with anticipation of future backend API integration (Node.js/Django).

## 💡 Note on Assets and Deployment
> **Status of Media Files:** All images, project screenshots, and certifications are currently linked using **external direct URLs (from hosting services)**. This approach was chosen for rapid prototyping and seamless testing. For a full production build, these assets would be migrated to a local `/assets/images` directory to ensure long-term stability and faster loading times, adhering to industry best practices.
